# SUMO Traffic Simulation

The "Simulation of Urban MObility" (SUMO) environment was used to model traffic junctions. 

.xml file contains the drawn intersection model. It includes defined roads, intersections. 
Additionally, in the .rou.xml file, traffic flow for the drawn intersection is written and traffic routes, number of vehicles, type of vehicles are specified.
In the .sumocfg, "net-file" and "route-files" are declared. The designed model can be viewed by opening this file with the SUMO application.

Simulation of a sample traffic was executed. The final outcome is as follows:
